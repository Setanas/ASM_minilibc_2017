# ASM minilibc

Minilibc is one of the second year project in Epitech. <br/>
In this project we had to recode C functions in ASM

## Getting Started

This library is programmed in ASM on a Linux environment.<br/>

### Prerequisites

To compile/link we are using gcc.<br/>

### Installing

To create the library please use the Makefile
 
```
$> make
```

At the end you should have a "libasm.so" shared library in your current folder.
